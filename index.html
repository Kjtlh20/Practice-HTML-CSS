    <hr>
    <p class="bigLetter">Arisu, Karube, and Chōta, a trio of high school students, are bored with their current lives. During a firework celebration, Arisu wishes that he could live in a different world which would be more exciting for him. As such, his wish was granted,
        and the three were transported into a seemingly post-apocalyptic-like parallel world. After stepping into what seems to be an empty festival, they are greeted by a woman who tells them that they have already "entered their game". After clearing
        the game, she reveals to them that, in Borderland, they must play games to survive.</p>
